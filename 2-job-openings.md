### Community and Content Intern

### UI / UX Designer

We're looking for a contract designer who can help us take [our](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/yen/a-quick-visual-update--MJiEOsQ8O8fbQ97vBUM) [initial](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/yen/a-few-animated-gifs--MExkTE12jGIn5DdI0Oe) [designs](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/yen/good-artists-copy--MFrFbk4F61COCakqCNC) and make them even better — give us your magic touch because we literally don't have any designers on the team right now. 

This is pretty cool gig because:

- We have real (and amazing!) [users](https://twitter.com/yenFTW/status/1340163010409627650)! You get to work on a product that has real demand and real, daily use. You'll see your work (and impact) immediately.
- We're a pretty cool [team](https://github.com/yenio/handbook#our-team) and have an even cooler [community](http://yeniverse.com). 
- Our [culture](https://github.com/yenio/handbook#operating-virtues) is everything; we live out our `operating virtues`. 
- Our mission is important: `Democratize community building`. 

It would probably make sense if:

- You had a portfolio of work we could check out and review.
- You love online community and understand its fundamental importance in our lives.

It would be super-cool (but not a must-have):

- You knew how to take your design and convert it into into `.html` / `.css` / `.scss` and maybe even `react` components...?

Sound interesting? Hit us up on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/yenftw/) or [email](mailto:john@yen.io).

- Integrate (existing) software components into a fully functional software system.
- Troubleshoot, debug, and upgrade existing systems.
- Build flowcharts, layouts, and supporting documentation (specifications) to determine feasibility.
- Comfortable with GitHub, ticketing, issues, and Kanban workflows.
- Engage with our community / users to gather and evaluate feedback.

**Qualifications / Skills:**

- Bachelors degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or related field is nice but not required.
- Minimum of 3-5 years of professional software development experience.
- Knows how to communicate fluently in a fully distributed, async culture.
- Knows how to engage directly (and enjoys it!) with users / community members to gather and qualify feedback into features.
- Experience with Java, Python, C++ and/or other OO programming languages *would be great*.
- Experience with AWS, Google Cloud, and other cloud providers, container-ized deployments, Kubernetes, Docker, *would be cool*.
- Knowledge of relational databases, SQL, and ORM technologies (JPA2, Hibernate) would be *a plus* (currently using MongoDB).
- Experience developing microservices & restful APIs would be *a plus* (currently monolithic-ish / REST-ish for our `mvp`).

**More Company Info:**

- We have an open source `#handbook` that can give you a really good sense of [who we are and what we believe](https://github.com/yenio/handbook).
- We [tweet](http://twitter.com/yenftw), hang out in [YouTube](http://yen.show), and have [an active blog](http://yensquad.com).
