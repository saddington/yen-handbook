### Frontend Software Engineer

This role will be responsible for helping to build out our early-stage `mvp` with a small team of 3. The ideal candidate enjoys writing and contributing high-performant, scalable code in a distributed, async, high-communication culture, focusing most of their time on our frontend. They will more than likely have extensive knowledge of a variety of languages and technologies like: React, Typescript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Firebase, MongoDB, NodeJS, NGINX, and a variety of well-known APIs / SDKs like Stripe.

**Compensation:**

- We're open to contract, part-time, contract-to-hire, and full-time! 
- We care more about *finding the right person* than the number of hours they have available (we currently employ a mix of FT, PT, and contractors).

**Core Responsibilties:**

- Develop & expand on our existing codebase, staying true to our [operating virtues](https://github.com/yenio/handbook#operating-virtues) while adding their own creativity to the mix.
- Work independently & collaboratively in a [fully-distributed](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/what-we-mean-when-we-say-we-are-a-distributed-first-team-0226d2f999), [async environment](https://github.com/yenio/handbook/blob/master/1-employment.md#distributed-first-async-team-communication).
- Integrate (existing) software components into a fully functional software system.
- Troubleshoot, debug, and upgrade existing systems.
- Build flowcharts, layouts, and supporting documentation (specifications) to determine feasibility.
- Comfortable with GitHub, ticketing, issues, and Kanban workflows.
- Engage with our community / users to gather and evaluate feedback.

**Qualifications / Skills:**

- Bachelors degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or related field is nice but not required.
- Minimum of 3-5 years of professional software development experience.
- Knows how to communicate fluently in a fully distributed, async culture.
- Knows how to engage directly (and enjoys it!) with users / community members to gather and qualify feedback into features.
- Experience with Java, Python, C++ and/or other OO programming languages would be great.
- Experience with AWS, Google Cloud, and other public cloud providers, container-ized deployments, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.
- Knowledge of relational databases, SQL, and ORM technologies (JPA2, Hibernate) would be a plus (currently using MongoDB).
- Experience with developing microservices & restful APIs a plus as we get ready for scale (we are currently a more monolithic, REST-ish for our `mvp`).

**More Company Info:**

- We have an open source `#handbook` that can give you a really good sense of [who we are and what we believe](https://github.com/yenio/handbook).
- We [tweet](http://twitter.com/yenftw), hang out in [YouTube](http://yen.show), and have [an active blog](http://yensquad.com).
