# Our Company Handbook
*A Collaborative Handbook for our Team & Community*

This `handbook` has gone through a number of changes over the years and this version is no exception! 

This repo does the following:

1. Gives a high-level overview of who we are, what we do, and why we do what we do...
2. Our compensation, benefits, and employment policies for our staff and team...
3. A cultural glossary of practices, quirks, principles, and operating virtues...
4. An assortment of other organization-centric things to know about...

It's a work-in-progress, something designed to be touched by anyone in our community. If you have thoughts, I'd [love to hear them](mailto:john@yen.io)!

Finally, I'm grateful that you're here and that you've decided to commit a season of your life helping to build a _meaningful_ and _impactful_ software product for our amazing community — their success (and ours) wouldn't be possible without you.

To infinity & community,

John // Chief Cartridge Blower

## Operating Virtues

Ben Horowitz via his book [What You Do is Who You Are](https://amzn.to/338OBm7) helped us frame our own:

>Bushido looks like a set of principles, but it’s a set of practices. The samurai defined culture as a code of action, a system not of values but of virtues. A value is merely a belief, but a virtue is a belief that you actively pursue or embody. 
>
>The reason so many efforts to establish “corporate values” are basically worthless is that they emphasize beliefs instead of actions. Culturally, what you believe means nearly nothing. What you do is who you are.

Consequently, here are our current `operating virtues` (taken from our [blog](https://john.do/day-one/)):


### 1. Table All The Things — `#tatt`
Or, in other words, we “put everything out on the table” — the good, the bad, and most definitely the ugly. Information is the lifeblood of our business which is especially true in a distributed-first organization. This means that we share things in real-time: We don’t wait for the timing to be “perfect” and we’re comfortable with sharing incomplete, imperfect, and unpolished ideas in prose.

[Candor](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/candor-the-secret-to-startup-success-de93cf7ace) is our weapon of choice — both a strategy and tactic.

We treat all updates from team members with respect knowing of the courage required to share something that could make the person "look" foolish or silly. Instead, we engage graciously, responding to the update with the care and attention that we’d hope to receive if it was our own, knowing that they’ve successfully modeled this virtue with excellence.

Finally, `#tatt` means that we may share things that of personal nature and are only meant for those presently at our table. Everything shared in our communication tools should be held in the highest regard and with strict confidence.

Our **table is strong** when **trust is the foundation**.


### 2. Speed of Decision Making — `#sodm`
No bullshit: We are in a fight for our survival and every single day we make business-altering decisions. And sometimes theese decisions are made without all of the data. Regardless, we agree with General Patton when he said “*A good plan, violently executed **now**, is better than a perfect plan next week.*” 

That “plan” is our first operating virtue, `#tatt`, because our team has mastered the art of communicating with [candor](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/candor-the-secret-to-startup-success-de93cf7ace): We are open, honest, and we keep things simple to maximize meaning and understanding. 

When making decisions, we clearly state if consensus or feedback is required, the expected time to deliver, and then, with enough collective confidence that we can create, we commit to the decision even (and especially) when we may personally disagree. 

We move the fastest and are the most effective **when we are aligned**.



### 3. Kaizen — `#kaizen`
When our team executes the first two `operating virtues` with excellence it allows us to build a culture of `continuous improvement`, both corporately and independently. We seek to do this in everything that we do. Consequently, everything in our business is dynamic, not static; a real-life work-in-progress.

We look for opportunities to not only grow but also to share our learnings with the other folks on our team — this is part of `#tatt`! Much has been written about the history and application of [kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) and it's worth developing your own personal philosophy and practice.

As a team we intentionally find opportunities to invest in ourselves and one another through continual education — reading, attending (virtual) conferences, and even taking educational courses to level-up as humans. Feel free use your monthly budget to invest in yourself!

John was most recently co-founder of Pinpoint, an engineering analytics company in Silicon Valley backed by some of the top names in VC (Bessemer, Storm Ventures, BoldStart, BloombergBeta, Slack Fund, Social Capital, and [more](https://john.do/pinpoint/)). Previously, he was a co-founder of The Iron Yard, the largest coding bootcamp before it was acquired by Apollo Global (Fortune 500). Through his love of open source he founded 8BIT, which was both an open source product (acquired by WooThemes) and a content company (acquired by WPEngine). He's [a](https://ceobrain.substack.com/) [writer](https://john.do), dad, and amateur [filmmaker](http://yen.show).

#### Agata Bergstrom - Engineering - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agatabergstrom)

Agata wrote her first lines of code when she was 9 years old. Won the Math Olympiad in Poland at the age of 14. Graduated with an MS degree in Computer Science from one of the top technical universities in Poland. Moved to Ireland and eventually settled in the beautiful Pacific Northwest region of the US. 10+ years of professional experience as an engineer, from an employee #50,000 to an employee #5.

In her past life Agata was a licensed skydiver (200+ skydives), amateur photographer and enjoyed flying tiny airplanes with her husband. Currently her favorite pastime is chasing her two little daughters and trying to keep them alive, which she finds more challenging than jumping out of airplanes.


#### Andrew J. Mason - Storytelling - [@AndrewJMason](https://twitter.com/andrewjmason)

Andrew is one of the best audio / video producers you’ve *_never_* heard of. John bought Andrew his first podcasting mic in 2009 and challenged him to give “this new thing called podcasting” a try. Since then, Andrew’s voice and production work has been featured on podcasts for major news outlets like Time, Wired, and Inc.com. He currently hosts & produces one of iTune's Top 100 Business podcasts: The “_Getting Things Done_” (GTD) show for David Allen Company. He also hosts & produces for WisdomDestinations.com.

#### Fred Wilby - Engineering - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredwilby)

Fred began his journey in web development freelancing for local businesses as a freshman in high school. Since then he's been fascinated by the possibilities enabled by interactive experiences on the Web. Fred found his entrance to the world of startups in 2015 when his freshman-year roommate convinced him to join his project in Cal Poly's accelerator. Fred became the technical co-founder and developed a [bluetooth connected smart alarm device](https://www.cob.calpoly.edu/newsevents/cal-poly-startup-dives-head-first-into-ces/). After that project ultimately ran out of funds, Fred joined up with another resident of the accelerator to build a pay-per-view influencer marketing marketplace that launched and was used by brands like Skullcandy, Sennheiser and Loot Crate. Fred moved on to spend the next few years at Zeus, a YC-backed corporate travel platform. There he led projects and scaled processes as the company grew from 7 engineers and 30 employees in SF to 30 engineers and over 300 employees spread around 6 metro areas. When not coding, Fred enjoys cooking (especially baking bread), obsessing over coffee, and various video games.

#### Michele Pridgeon - Content - [@authorettestory](https://twitter.com/authorettestory)

Long time 'teach myself what I need/want to know' kind of gal with books and the Internet. Michele has always written stories, self-published a novel and even sold a poem when she was 15. Michele taught herself how to create html pages when the Internet was new and before there were books out on how to do it. Played with creating graphics and digital art. When her daughter was born, Michele completed her Bachelor's degree in Marketing. During family time, Michele likes to play Minecraft with her hubbin and daughter and is currently creating art for her new house.

#### The Yenicorn - Mascot - [LinkedIn](http://yenicorn.com/)

According to myth and legend, our friend, The Yenicorn, was raised by a herd of Japanese unicorns in a mysterious other worldly… … world. She knows (as prophecy has foretold) that she has a very important part to play in the cryptocurrency community but is understandably a bit nervous and often lacks a bit of self-confidence (thus the helmet)  – but she wants to help people and do her very best!

## Our Story

Born out of the ashes of two pivots over 2+ years, we restarted YEN's story in early-2020 as we caught a vision for an exciting and inevitable future — a `vision` of a future where there's a "community on every website" and how we do that is through our `mission` to "democratize community building" for everyone, everywhere.

For starters, it looks like a simple `b2b` `saas` platform that helps businesses launch, manage, and grow a community right on their own website. Unlike other solutions that can take a lot of time to properly setup and install, we bring the community right to the business, maximizing their efforts and marketing ROI.

Built for speed, we help creators connect with their customers, monetize their projects and know-how, and build a community they can be super-proud of.

We are currently test-driving the mvp in our own business-building community.



























## Cultural Quirks

Here are a few things that aren't immediately obvious about us and our team.

### How We Refer To Ourselves:

- Legally, we are `ROFLCOPTER, INC.` But other than legal docs, you’ll rarely see this.
- Most commonly, we refer to the team, project, company as our core product, YEN.
- YEN (all caps) is not an acronym.
- You’ll also see accounts under [yen.io](http://yen.io) or `yenio` or `yenFTW` or `yen_io` (sometimes we couldn’t get just YEN)
- If "YEN" is combined with another "full" word, it's not capitalized (e.g. `YenIQ`)
- You can find our `brand` guidelines [here](https://john.do/brand-2019/). The colors and identifying marks are correct but most of the copy is not currently correct as we aren't in the `#defi` / `crypto` space anymore.

### Some Terms You'll See Tossed Around:

- `Yenizen` - Members of our amazing community ([here's our definition](http://yeniverse.com)
- `Yeniverse` - What we're building AND how we describe our community
- `Yeni` or `Yenni` (what community members named the company mascot, the [Yenicorn](http://yenicorn.com))
- `yenSTRONG` - When one of our community members does something amazing and supportive of another `yenizen`.
- `yenSQUAD` - An alternative way / loving way of talking about our community
- `yenED` — Any of our educational courses or [workshops](http://yen.education).

### "My Meeting, My Notes"

- When you call or 'own' the meeting, you are responsible for taking notes and dispersing them along with action items after the meeting so those who weren't able to attend are made aware. We usually just drop those in Slack post-meeting.

### "`DELEBRATE` ALL THE THINGS!"

- At YEN we love to "decentralize celebration" and take time to celebrate individual and collective wins as often as we can! Anytime we **hit a goal** or complete a major milestone, we try to do something special for ourselves, our team, and our family(ies). Use the Brex card.

### Wednesday Team Lunch

- Until someone on our team comes up with a better name for this... it's just called "Team Food Day"! On `Wednesdays` the company trades one meal of your choice (Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner... or Second Dinner...) for a picture of it! Feel free to pay for the family too! Use the Brex card.

### We Like Systems of 3

- 3 letters in our domain name, 3 operating virtues, the "3 E's" that make up a `yenizen`... easy to remember too.

















































































## Policy Changes and Legal Stuff
*The only constant is change...*

We want all of our policies to be living documents which can improve and change as we learn and grow as a company. This is how we'll propose and make changes to our policies.

Right now, we use the following tools to discuss the Handbook:

1. **GitHub** - The canonical resource. Feel free to open a pull request with context!

2. **In Person Meetings** - Our hope is that as we grow and scale, we'll have more opportunities to gather in-person and virtually to discuss the #handbook openly.



#### Handbook Use, Policy

This Employee Handbook describes the employment policies applicable to all employees of the Company. Where there are differences in the terms applicable to employees in different jurisdictions, the differences are noted in the Handbook. This Handbook is not a contract, express or implied, guaranteeing employment for any specific duration.

This Handbook is designed to familiarize employees with the employment policies of YEN. Employees should read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Handbook. It describes many of the responsibilities of an employee and outlines the programs developed by YEN to benefit its employees.

No Employee Handbook can anticipate every circumstance or question about policy. As YEN continues to grow and as business needs, employment legislation and economic conditions change, YEN reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policies or portion of the Handbook from time to time as it deems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion. No statement or promise by any other member of the Company can be interpreted as a change in policy nor will it constitute an agreement with an employee. Employees will be notified of such changes to the Employee Handbook as they occur.

Should there be any discrepancy between the Handbook and other documents of the Company, the policies incorporated in the Handbook shall govern. This Employee Handbook supersedes any and all other previous YEN Employee Handbooks or other YEN policies, whether written or oral.

Policies set forth in this Handbook are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations of any kind or a contract of employment between YEN and any of its employees. No person can enter into an employment contract with YEN for a specified period of time or make any agreement contrary to this policy without written approval from CEO.

The provisions of the handbook have been developed at the discretion of management and may be audited, amended or cancelled at any time, at YEN’s sole discretion. Whenever the word “Company” is used, it refers to the employer, “YEN”.
