# Our Company Handbook
*A Collaborative Handbook for our Team & Community*

This `handbook` has gone through a number of changes over the years and this version is no exception! This version _should_ be the most "usable" as there's only a few pages to review (and update...)!

This repository serves these purposes:

1. Gives a high-level overview of who we are, what we do, and why we do what we do
2. Our compensation, benefits, and employment policies for our staff and team
3. A cultural glossary of practices, principles, and operating virtues
4. And anything else we might think of...

It's a work-in-progress, something designed to be touched by anyone in our community. I'm particularly interested in getting feedback from new community members as you all will see things that the current team may unintentionally (and intentionally) ignore! Please help us identify our blindspots and **question everything**—[kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)!

I'm so grateful that you're here and that you've decided to commit a season of your life helping to build _meaningful_ and _impactful_ software for the YEN community! You're here because success isn't possible without you.

To infinity (and bitcoin).

## Operating Virtues

Ben Horowitz via his book [What You Do is Who You Are](https://amzn.to/338OBm7) helped us frame our own:

>Bushido looks like a set of principles, but it’s a set of practices. The samurai defined culture as a code of action, a system not of values but of virtues. A value is merely a belief, but a virtue is a belief that you actively pursue or embody. 
>
>The reason so many efforts to establish “corporate values” are basically worthless is that they emphasize beliefs instead of actions. Culturally, what you believe means nearly nothing. What you do is who you are.

Consequently, here are our current `operating virtues` (taken from our [blog](https://blog.yen.io/day-one/)):


### 1. Table All The Things — `#tatt`
Or, in other words, we “put everything out on the table” — the good, the bad, and most definitely the ugly. Information is the lifeblood of our business which is especially true in a distributed-first organization. This means that we share things in real-time: We don’t wait for the timing to be “perfect” and we’re comfortable with sharing incomplete, imperfect, and unpolished prose. 

Consequently, this means that what we share is going to be, quite often, incomplete, imperfect, and in sore need of serious polishing — we treat all updates with respect, knowing of the courage required to share something that may make the person look foolish, silly, or even stupid. Instead, we engage graciously, responding to the update with the care and attention that we’d hope to receive if it was our own, knowing that they’ve successfully modeled this virtue with excellence.

Finally, #tatt means that we’ll often share things that are intensely personal and are only meant for those presently at our table. Everything shared in our communication tools should be held in the highest regard and with strict confidence.

Our table is strong when trust is the foundation.


### 2. Speed of Decision Making — `#sodm`
No bullshit: We are in a fight for our very survival and every single day we make life-altering decisions — sometimes, with very little data. Regardless, we agree with General Patton when he said “A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.” 

That “plan”, by the way, is our first operating virtue, #tatt, because our team has mastered the art of communicating plainly the high-level context, the people involved, and the decision(s) that need to be made and by what time (and by whom). We clearly state if consensus or feedback is required and, with enough collective confidence that we can bear, we commit to the decision, even if we may personally disagree. We move the fastest when we are aligned, feelings aside.

Otherwise, you should #tatt, providing all the above data and informing the team of your decision with a request for specific people to keep you accountable — this simply means that you will do what you say you’ll do and you’re asking for support in keeping that commitment on track.






























## Our Team

He's [a](https://ceobrain.substack.com/) [writer](https://john.do), dad, and amateur [filmmaker](http://yen.show).

#### Agata Bergstrom - Engineering - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agatabergstrom)

Agata wrote her first lines of code when she was 9 years old. Won the Math Olympiad in Poland at the age of 14. Graduated with an MS degree in Computer Science from one of the top technical universities in Poland. Moved to Ireland and eventually settled in the beautiful Pacific Northwest region of the US. 10+ years of professional experience as an engineer, from an employee #50,000 to an employee #5.

In her past life Agata was a licensed skydiver (200+ skydives), amateur photographer and enjoyed flying tiny airplanes with her husband. Currently her favorite pastime is chasing her two little daughters and trying to keep them alive, which she finds more challenging than jumping out of airplanes.

#### Andrew J. Mason - Storytelling - [@AndrewJMason](https://twitter.com/andrewjmason)

Andrew is one of the best audio / video producers you’ve *_never_* heard of. John bought Andrew his first podcasting mic in 2009 and challenged him to give “this new thing called podcasting” a try. Since then, Andrew’s voice and production work has been featured on podcasts for major news outlets like Time, Wired, and Inc.com. He currently hosts & produces one of iTune's Top 100 Business podcasts: The “_Getting Things Done_” (GTD) show for David Allen Company. He also hosts & produces for WisdomDestinations.com. Andrew enjoys spending time with his wife, two boys, and 13 year old Dachsund named Harmony.

#### Eugene Zaretskiy - Engineering - [GitHub](https://github.com/EugeneZ)

Eugene has been programming for a long time (not well for most of it). He got addicted to Javascript after discovering MooTools in 2007. He is fascinated by functional programming but too scared to commit fully to Elm. In his spare time, he plays indie video games (currently addicted to [Slay the Spire](https://www.megacrit.com/)), board games (favorite board game is [Vlaada Chvatil's Mage Knight](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/96848/mage-knight-board-game)), and books (favorite author is the late [Gene Wolfe](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23069.Gene_Wolfe)).

#### The Yenicorn - Mascot - [LinkedIn](https://yenicorn.com/about/)

According to myth and legend, our friend, The Yenicorn, was raised by a herd of Japanese unicorns in a mysterious other worldly… … world. She knows (as prophecy has foretold) that she has a very important part to play in the cryptocurrency community but is understandably a bit nervous and often lacks a bit of self-confidence (thus the helmet)  – but she wants to help people and do her very best!

#### Venture Capital Firms

We're fortunate to have the financial support from the following (repeat!) venture firms:

1. [Cherubic VC](https://cherubic.com/)
2. [Hustle Fund](https://www.hustlefund.vc/)
3. [LINE Corp](https://lineventurescorp.com/en/)
4. [Sterling Road VC](https://www.sterlingroad.com/)
5. [Service Provider Capital](http://www.serviceprovidercapital.com/)

We also have a top-flight group of Angel Investors who act as both advisors and personal friends.





























## Our Story

Born out of the ashes of two pivots over two+ years, YEN's story begins anew in 2020 as we double-down on our mission to solve an existential problem for all startup founders: **Survival**.

More specifically, business builders must quickly build a `community` around their project before it dies from lack of attention and revenue (customers)! And, without a community, founders won't have the necessary feedback that they need to build and iterate on their product as they march towards product-market fit.

Simply put, `founders need community around their new project, fast`. 

That's what we're building... that's our mission: **YEN helps founders launch a branded community platform in just a few clicks.**

Unlike other solutions that can take a lot of time to properly setup and install, we bring your community to you, right on your own website, zero configuration required.

Built for speed, we help creators connect with their customers, monetize their projects and know-how, and build a community they can be super-proud of.

We are currently test-driving the mvp in our own business-building community.



























## Cultural Quirks

Here are a few things that aren't immediately obvious about us and our team.

**How we refer to ourselves**

- Legally, we are `ROFLCOPTER, INC.` But other than legal docs, you’ll rarely see this.
- Most commonly, we refer to team, project, company as our core product, YEN.
- YEN (all caps) is not an acronym.
- You’ll also see accounts under [yen.io](http://yen.io) or `yenio` or `yenFTW` or `yen_io` (sometimes we couldn’t get just YEN)
- If "YEN" is combined with another word, it's not capitalized (e.g. `YenIQ`)
- You can find our `brand` guidelines [here](https://john.do/brand-2019/). It is outdated, copy-wise, but the colors and other identifying marks are correct.

**Some terms you’ll see tossed around:**

- `Yenizen` - Members of our amazing community
- `Yeniverse` - What we're building AND how we describe our community
- `Yeni` or `Yenni` (what community members named the company mascot, the [Yenicorn](https://yenicorn.com))
- `yenSTRONG` - When one of our community members does something amazing and supportive of another `yenizen`.
- `yenSQUAD` - An alternative way / loving way of talking about our community
- `yenIVERSITY` — Any of our educational courses or [workshops](http://yen.education).

**My Meeting, My Notes**

- When you call or 'own' the meeting, you are responsible for taking notes and dispersing them along with action items after the meeting so those who weren't able to attend are made aware. We usually just drop those in Slack post-meeting.























































































## Policy Changes and Legal Stuff
*The only constant is change...*

We want all of our policies to be living documents which can improve and change as we learn and grow as a company. This is how we'll propose and make changes to our policies.

Right now, we use the following tools to discuss the Handbook:

1. **GitHub** - The canonical resource. Feel free to open a pull request with context!

2. **In Person Meetings** - Our hope is that as we grow and scale, we'll have more opportunities to gather in-person and virtually to discuss the #handbook openly.



#### Handbook Use, Policy

This Employee Handbook describes the employment policies applicable to all employees of the Company. Where there are differences in the terms applicable to employees in different jurisdictions, the differences are noted in the Handbook. This Handbook is not a contract, express or implied, guaranteeing employment for any specific duration.

This Handbook is designed to familiarize employees with the employment policies of YEN. Employees should read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Handbook. It describes many of the responsibilities of an employee and outlines the programs developed by YEN to benefit its employees.

No Employee Handbook can anticipate every circumstance or question about policy. As YEN continues to grow and as business needs, employment legislation and economic conditions change, YEN reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policies or portion of the Handbook from time to time as it deems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion. No statement or promise by any other member of the Company can be interpreted as a change in policy nor will it constitute an agreement with an employee. Employees will be notified of such changes to the Employee Handbook as they occur.

Should there be any discrepancy between the Handbook and other documents of the Company, the policies incorporated in the Handbook shall govern. This Employee Handbook supersedes any and all other previous YEN Employee Handbooks or other YEN policies, whether written or oral.

Policies set forth in this Handbook are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations of any kind or a contract of employment between YEN and any of its employees. No person can enter into an employment contract with YEN for a specified period of time or make any agreement contrary to this policy without written approval from CEO.

The provisions of the handbook have been developed at the discretion of management and may be audited, amended or cancelled at any time, at YEN’s sole discretion. Whenever the word “Company” is used, it refers to the employer, “YEN”.
